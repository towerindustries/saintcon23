# SaintCon 2023 - Intro to Cloud Automation with Terraform
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and instructions for the SaintCon 2023 - Intro to Cloud Automation with Terraform workshop.  This workshop will introduce you to the basics of Terraform and how to use it to automate the creation of cloud resources.  We will be using AWS as our cloud provider for this workshop, but the concepts can be applied to other cloud providers as well. --CoPilot

## Prerequisites
* AWS Account
* AWS CLI
* Terraform
* Git
* Text Editor

## AWS Account
You will need an AWS account to complete this workshop.  If you do not already have an AWS account, you can create one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).  You will need to provide a credit card to create an AWS account, but you will not be charged for any of the resources used in this workshop.  If you are concerned about being charged for resources, you can set up a billing alarm in the AWS console to notify you if your account exceeds a certain amount. --CoPilot

## AWS CLI
The AWS CLI is a command line tool that allows you to interact with AWS services from the command line.  You can download the AWS CLI [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).  Once you have the AWS CLI installed, you will need to configure it with your AWS credentials.  You can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).  --CoPilot

## Terraform
Terraform is an open source tool that allows you to automate the creation of cloud resources.  You can download Terraform [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).  Once you have Terraform installed, you will need to add it to your PATH.  You can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix).  --CoPilot

## Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files.  You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  Once you have Git installed, you will need to configure it with your name and email address.  You can find instructions on how to do that [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).  --CoPilot

## Text Editor
You will need a text editor to edit the Terraform files.  You can use any text editor you like, but I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  --CoPilot
